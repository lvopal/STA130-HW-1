This method provides both the direction and strength of association between the two variables, offering insights into the potential impact of social connections on emotional health. I plan to use simple linear regression. Linear regression is used because it can model the relationship between having someone to share feelings with, represented by an indicator variable, and the outcome variable, emptiness. This method is appropriate because it allows examination of whether changes in the predictor variable (having someone to share with) are associated with changes in the outcome variable (emptiness) \"on average"
